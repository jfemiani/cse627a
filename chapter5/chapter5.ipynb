    "A common definition of an artificial neural network:\n",
    "> In computer science, a neural network is a type of machine learning model that is designed to mimic the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of a large number of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that are organized into layers. Each neuron takes in a set of input values, performs a computation, and passes the result to the next layer of neurons until the output is produced. Neural networks are used for a wide range of tasks, including classification, regression, image and speech recognition, and natural language processing. They are particularly well-suited to handling complex, high-dimensional data that is difficult to analyze using traditional machine learning techniques. -- ChatGPT"
