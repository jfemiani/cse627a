Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – Multinomial observation representation  
Points: 1  
1. In the multinomial model, how is each observation typically represented?  
a) As a scalar index between 1 and $K$  
... Incorrect. While categories can be indexed this way in code, the model assumes a richer representation.  
*b) As a $K$-dimensional one-hot encoded vector  
... Correct. This representation has exactly one element equal to 1 and all others 0.  
c) As a probability vector summing to 1  
... Incorrect. This describes a parameter, not a single observation.  
d) As a binary vector with two ones  
... Incorrect. A one-hot vector contains exactly one 1.

Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – Multinomial likelihood with counts  
Points: 1  
1. What is the likelihood function for the multinomial distribution with counts $m_1,\dots,m_K$ and parameters $\mu_1,\dots,\mu_K$?  
a) $\prod_{k=1}^K \mu_k^{m_k}$  
... Incorrect. This omits the combinatorial coefficient accounting for sample permutations.  
*b) $\displaystyle \frac{N!}{m_1!\cdots m_K!}\prod_{k=1}^K \mu_k^{m_k}$  
... Correct. This is the complete likelihood function, including normalization.  
c) $\sum_{k=1}^K \mu_k^{m_k}$  
... Incorrect. Likelihoods for independent outcomes are multiplied, not summed.  
d) $\prod_{k=1}^K (m_k\,\mu_k)$  
... Incorrect. This form is incorrect — the likelihood includes exponents and coefficients.

Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – Constraints on multinomial parameters  
Points: 1  
1. What constraints must the parameters $\mu_1,\dots,\mu_K$ of a multinomial distribution satisfy?  
a) Each $\mu_k > 0$  
... Incorrect. This condition is necessary but incomplete.  
b) The sum $\sum_{k=1}^K \mu_k = 1$  
... Incorrect. The sum must equal 1, but individual parameters must also be nonnegative.  
*c) Each $\mu_k \ge 0$ and $\sum_{k=1}^K \mu_k = 1$  
... Correct. These two conditions together define a valid probability distribution over $K$ outcomes.  
d) Each $\mu_k$ can be any real number  
... Incorrect. Probabilities must be nonnegative and sum to 1.

Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – Conjugate prior for multinomial  
Points: 1  
1. Which distribution serves as the conjugate prior for the parameters of a multinomial likelihood?  
a) Beta distribution  
... Incorrect. The Beta is the special case for $K=2$ categories.  
*b) Dirichlet distribution  
... Correct. The Dirichlet distribution is the standard conjugate prior for multinomial parameters.  
c) Gaussian distribution  
... Incorrect. Gaussian distributions are not defined over the simplex and are not conjugate to the multinomial.  
d) Poisson distribution  
... Incorrect. The Poisson models counts, not probabilities over categories.

Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – Dirichlet as generalization  
Points: 1  
1. The Dirichlet distribution is a multivariate generalization of which distribution?  
a) Bernoulli distribution  
... Incorrect. The Bernoulli models binary outcomes, not continuous probability vectors.  
*b) Beta distribution  
... Correct. The Beta is the special case of the Dirichlet for $K = 2$ categories.  
c) Binomial distribution  
... Incorrect. The Binomial models discrete counts, not distributions over probabilities.  
d) Uniform distribution  
... Incorrect. While the uniform distribution arises when all Dirichlet parameters are equal to 1, it is not the correct generalization.


Title: medium – apply – non-edge – Posterior update for Dirichlet prior  
Points: 1
1. Suppose a Dirichlet prior has parameters $\alpha_1=2$, $\alpha_2=3$, $\alpha_3=4$, and a dataset has observed counts $m_1=1$, $m_2=2$, $m_3=1$. What are the parameters of the posterior Dirichlet distribution?
a) $\alpha_1=3$, $\alpha_2=5$, $\alpha_3=4$
... Incorrect. These values do not correctly apply the update rule.
*b) $\alpha_1=3$, $\alpha_2=5$, $\alpha_3=5$
... Correct. Each posterior parameter is the sum of prior and observed counts.
c) $\alpha_1=1$, $\alpha_2=1$, $\alpha_3=1$
... Incorrect. These are lower than the prior values.
d) $\alpha_1=2$, $\alpha_2=2$, $\alpha_3=2$
... Incorrect. This ignores the observed counts.


Title: medium – understand – non-edge – Interpretation of Dirichlet parameters  
Points: 1
1. In a Dirichlet distribution, what does a larger value of $\alpha_k$ imply about the prior belief?
a) That the corresponding category is unlikely  
... Incorrect. Higher $\alpha_k$ reflects stronger belief in category $k$.
*b) That we have stronger prior belief in category $k$  
... Correct. Larger $\alpha_k$ corresponds to more pseudo-counts.
c) That category $k$ has higher variance  
... Incorrect. Increasing $\alpha_k$ reduces variance.
d) That category $k$ is excluded  
... Incorrect. Zero values would suppress the category entirely.


Title: hard – evaluate – edge – Effect of small Dirichlet hyperparameters  
Points: 1
1. What is the likely effect of choosing very small Dirichlet hyperparameters (e.g., all $\alpha_k < 1$) in a Bayesian multinomial model?
a) The posterior will be dominated by the prior  
... Incorrect. Small $\alpha_k$ values make the prior weak.
b) The model will assume all outcomes are equally likely  
... Incorrect. That corresponds to $\alpha_k = 1$.
*c) The model will favor sparse distributions where some categories dominate  
... Correct. Small $\alpha_k$ encourage distributions near the edges of the simplex.
d) The prior will have no effect at all  
... Incorrect. It still influences posterior even if weak.


Title: medium – analyze – non-edge – Likelihood vs prior vs posterior  
Points: 1
1. In Bayesian multinomial modeling, what distinguishes the likelihood from the prior and the posterior?
a) The likelihood is a distribution over parameters  
... Incorrect. That describes the prior or posterior.
*b) The likelihood is a function of the parameters given observed data  
... Correct. The likelihood evaluates how well parameters explain the data.
c) The prior incorporates observed counts  
... Incorrect. The prior is specified before observing data.
d) The posterior does not depend on the likelihood  
... Incorrect. Posterior is proportional to prior times likelihood.
