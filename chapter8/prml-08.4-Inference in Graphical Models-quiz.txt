Title: concept-check – understand – non-edge – clamping a variable  
Points: 1  
1. What happens when a variable is clamped to an observed value in a chain-structured MRF?  
a) It is removed from the graph entirely  
... Incorrect. The node remains and participates in inference.  
*b) Its message becomes a one-hot indicator function centered at the observed value  
... Correct. Clamping replaces summation with a delta function that filters compatible paths.  
c) Only the backward message is updated  
... Incorrect. Clamping affects both forward and backward message flow.  
d) The variable’s potential is dropped from the model  
... Incorrect. Potentials remain, and the value is inserted into them.

Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – single marginal cost  
Points: 1  
2. In a chain with 5 variables, each taking $K$ values, what is the cost of computing $p(x_3)$ using message passing?  
a) $O(K^5)$  
... Incorrect. That is the cost of brute-force enumeration.  
*b) $O(K^2 \cdot N)$  
... Correct. Each message update is $O(K^2)$ and there are $N-1$ messages.  
c) $O(K \cdot \log K)$  
... Incorrect. No log terms are involved in exact message passing.  
d) $O(K^3)$  
... Incorrect. That would be the cost of interacting three variables jointly.  

Title: medium – analyze – non-edge – cost of all marginals  
Points: 1  
3. How does the cost of computing all marginals $p(x_1), \dots, p(x_N)$ compare to computing a single $p(x_n)$ in a chain?  
a) It requires $N$ times more work than computing one marginal  
... Incorrect. Messages can be reused across all marginals.  
*b) It requires only one forward and one backward pass — total cost is $O(NK^2)$  
... Correct. All marginals can be computed with shared messages in linear time.  
c) It depends on which node is queried first  
... Incorrect. Message order doesn’t affect total cost.  
d) It is exponential in the number of variables  
... Incorrect. That applies only to naive enumeration, not message passing.
