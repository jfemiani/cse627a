Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – clique potential definition  
Points: 1  
1. In a Markov Random Field (MRF), what is the role of a potential function $\psi_C(x_C)$?  
a) It defines a normalized probability over the variables in clique $C$  
... Incorrect. Potentials are unnormalized; they only need to be non-negative.  
b) It defines a prior distribution over the entire graph  
... Incorrect. Potentials operate locally over cliques, not the full graph.  
*c) It assigns a non-negative compatibility score to configurations of variables in clique $C$  
... Correct. Potentials are local scoring functions used to build the unnormalized joint.  
d) It computes the conditional probability of one node given its neighbors  
... Incorrect. That describes the Gibbs distribution, not the role of $\psi$.  

Title: medium – analyze – edge – graph separation semantics  
Points: 1  
2. According to the separation rule in MRFs, when are two variable sets $A$ and $B$ conditionally independent given $C$?  
*a) When all paths from $A$ to $B$ pass through at least one node in $C$  
... Correct. This is the graph separation criterion used in undirected models.  
b) When $A$ and $B$ share no edges in the graph  
... Incorrect. That implies marginal independence, not conditional.  
c) When $C$ forms a clique containing both $A$ and $B$  
... Incorrect. That structure generally induces dependence.  
d) When $C$ contains all maximal cliques that include variables in $A$ or $B$  
... Incorrect. Clique coverage does not imply conditional independence.  

Title: hard – apply – edge – Ising model energy terms  
Points: 1  
3. In the Ising model energy  
   $$E(x, y) = \sum_i h x_i - \beta \sum_{\{i,j\}} x_i x_j - \eta \sum_i x_i y_i$$  
   what is the role of the term $-\beta \sum_{\{i,j\}} x_i x_j$?  
a) It encourages alignment between latent $x_i$ and observed $y_i$  
... Incorrect. That’s the role of the $-\eta$ term.  
*b) It penalizes disagreement between neighboring nodes $x_i$ and $x_j$  
... Correct. This term encourages neighbors to have the same value when $\beta > 0$.  
c) It suppresses all configurations except the minimum-energy one  
... Incorrect. It shapes the distribution, but does not exclude configurations.  
d) It ensures that the resulting distribution is normalized  
... Incorrect. Normalization comes from the partition function $Z$.  


Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – partition function role  
Points: 1  
4. In an MRF, what is the function of the partition function $Z$?  
a) It enforces local normalization for each clique  
... Incorrect. Potentials are not normalized locally.  
*b) It normalizes the full joint distribution to ensure it sums to 1  
... Correct. $Z = \sum_x \prod_C \psi_C(x_C)$ makes the distribution valid.  
c) It computes the log-likelihood for observed data  
... Incorrect. That would involve evaluating $p(x)$, not computing $Z$ per se.  
d) It eliminates cycles in the graph  
... Incorrect. $Z$ is unrelated to the graph structure itself.  

Title: concept-check – understand – non-edge – local Markov property  
Points: 1  
5. What does the local Markov property state for a Markov Random Field?  
*a) A variable is conditionally independent of all others given its immediate neighbors  
... Correct. This defines the Markov blanket in undirected models.  
b) A variable's probability depends only on the variables in its maximal clique  
... Incorrect. Maximal cliques may include non-neighboring nodes.  
c) A variable is conditionally independent of its neighbors given its parents  
... Incorrect. That applies to Bayesian networks, not MRFs.  
d) A variable is only independent if the graph is fully disconnected  
... Incorrect. Independence depends on graph structure, not isolation.  

Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – Hammersley-Clifford statement  
Points: 1  
6. What does the Hammersley-Clifford theorem say about strictly positive distributions?  
*a) That separation in the graph implies conditional independence if and only if the distribution factorizes over cliques  
... Correct. The theorem links separation semantics to clique-based factorization.  
b) That potentials must form a convex function over the cliques  
... Incorrect. The theorem does not constrain the shape of potentials.  
c) That marginal probabilities can be computed locally from any clique  
... Incorrect. Marginals generally require global normalization.  
d) That energy functions must be additive over disjoint components  
... Incorrect. This is true structurally, but not what the theorem asserts.  

Title: medium – apply – edge – conditional independence test  
Points: 1  
7. In an MRF, how can you test if $A \perp\!\!\!\perp B \mid C$ using the separation rule?  
a) Remove all edges in $C$ and check if $A$ and $B$ are d-separated  
... Incorrect. That describes separation in directed models.  
*b) Remove all nodes in $C$ and their edges; if $A$ and $B$ are disconnected, they are conditionally independent  
... Correct. Graph separation in undirected models implies conditional independence.  
c) Check whether $A$ and $B$ are not part of the same maximal clique  
... Incorrect. Clique membership does not imply dependence.  
d) Confirm that $C$ lies on every path between $A$ and $B$ in the moral graph  
... Incorrect. Moralization applies to directed models, not MRFs.  


Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – MRF neighborhood semantics  
Points: 1  
8. What is the Markov blanket of a variable in an MRF?  
a) Its parents and children  
... Incorrect. That describes Bayesian networks, not MRFs.  
*b) Its immediate neighbors in the undirected graph  
... Correct. In an MRF, the Markov blanket is the set of adjacent nodes.  
c) All nodes in the same clique  
... Incorrect. Cliques may include transitive relationships, not just neighbors.  
d) Nodes that share a potential with the variable  
... Incorrect. Potentials may span beyond direct adjacency.  


Title: hard – analyze – edge – moralization impact  
Points: 1  
9. What is a consequence of converting a Bayesian network into an MRF via moralization?  
*a) The resulting MRF may lose some of the original conditional independencies  
... Correct. Moralization can create extra edges, destroying some d-separation-based independencies.  
b) The resulting graph becomes a tree  
... Incorrect. Cycles are allowed in MRFs; trees are not required.  
c) The distribution becomes a mixture of directed and undirected components  
... Incorrect. Moralization results in a fully undirected model.  
d) The graph must be reparameterized using energy functions  
... Incorrect. The underlying distribution can stay the same; only the representation changes.  


Title: medium – understand – non-edge – perfect map meaning  
Points: 1  
10. What does it mean for a graph to be a “perfect map” of a distribution?  
a) It includes only the dependencies present in the distribution  
... Incorrect. That’s a D-map.  
*b) It captures exactly the independencies that hold in the distribution  
... Correct. A perfect map is both an I-map and a D-map — no more, no less.  
c) It uses the smallest number of edges needed for a valid factorization  
... Incorrect. Minimality is desirable but not part of the definition.  
d) It has disjoint cliques that cover all variables  
... Incorrect. Cliques can and often do overlap.  


Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – moralization procedure  
Points: 1  
11. What are the steps in moralizing a Bayesian network?  
a) Reverse all arrows and collapse common descendants  
... Incorrect. That does not preserve dependencies correctly.  
*b) Add undirected edges between all co-parents, then drop all edge directions  
... Correct. This produces an undirected graph with preserved dependency scope.  
c) Remove leaf nodes and triangulate remaining cliques  
... Incorrect. That’s not part of moralization.  
d) Convert all deterministic nodes to observed nodes  
... Incorrect. Moralization is about structure, not node types.  


Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – clique definition  
Points: 1  
12. What is a clique in an undirected graph?  
a) A set of nodes that all have the same degree  
... Incorrect. Degree uniformity is unrelated to cliques.  
*b) A subset of nodes where every pair of nodes is connected by an edge  
... Correct. This is the definition of a clique.  
c) A maximal connected component of the graph  
... Incorrect. That refers to components, not cliques.  
d) A set of nodes that share a common neighbor  
... Incorrect. That does not imply full connectivity.  


Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – maximal clique definition  
Points: 1  
13. What is a maximal clique in a graph?  
a) A clique that contains the maximum number of nodes in the entire graph  
... Incorrect. That would be a maximum clique.  
*b) A clique that cannot be extended by adding another adjacent node  
... Correct. Maximal means inclusion-wise maximal, not globally largest.  
c) A clique that is part of every possible factorization  
... Incorrect. Factorizations can vary.  
d) A clique that has the lowest energy under the Boltzmann distribution  
... Incorrect. That confuses structure with inference.  


Title: hard – analyze – edge – non-max clique potentials  
Points: 1  
14. Why is it acceptable for potential functions to involve non-maximal cliques, even though maximal cliques are often used?  
a) Only maximal cliques allow exact inference via message passing  
... Incorrect. Inference depends on structure and algorithm, not clique size.  
*b) Any product of potentials over smaller subsets can be absorbed into a potential over the containing maximal clique  
... Correct. Factorizations are equivalent as long as they cover the same variable scopes.  
c) Only non-maximal cliques are permitted in exponential family distributions  
... Incorrect. There is no such constraint.  
d) Boltzmann distributions require one potential per edge only  
... Incorrect. They may include both unary and pairwise (or higher) potentials.  


Title: medium – understand – non-edge – ICM update rule  
Points: 1  
16. In the ICM algorithm for MAP inference, what happens during each update step?  
a) The entire configuration $x$ is resampled jointly from the posterior  
... Incorrect. ICM updates one variable at a time.  
*b) A single variable $x_i$ is set to the value that maximizes $p(x_i \mid x_{\setminus i}, y)$  
... Correct. ICM performs greedy local updates to reduce energy.  
c) A pair of neighboring variables is updated by sampling from their marginal  
... Incorrect. That would be a form of Gibbs sampling or block sampling.  
d) Potentials are recomputed using backpropagation through the energy function  
... Incorrect. ICM is not a gradient-based method.
