Title: concept-check – understand – non-edge – Volume of central subcube  
Points: 1  
1. In a $D$-dimensional unit cube, what happens to the volume of the central subcube $[0, 0.5]^D$ as $D$ increases?  
a) It stays the same  
... Incorrect. The volume shrinks exponentially with dimension.  
*b) It decreases exponentially  
... Correct. The volume is $(0.5)^D$, which vanishes as $D$ grows.  
c) It increases linearly  
... Incorrect. Volume increases only if the subcube expands.  
d) It fluctuates but stays near 0.5  
... Incorrect. The decline is consistent and exponential.


Title: medium – apply – edge – Shell concentration in high-dimensional Gaussians  
Points: 1  
1. Why does a standard Gaussian distribution in $\mathbb{R}^D$ concentrate its mass in a thin shell as $D$ increases?  
a) The density increases with distance from the origin  
... Incorrect. Gaussian density decreases exponentially with distance.  
*b) Most samples occur near the radius where shell volume and density balance  
... Correct. The shell volume increases with radius, offsetting the drop in density until a peak at $r \approx \sqrt{D}$.  
c) Most samples lie near the origin because the density is highest there  
... Incorrect. The origin has highest density but negligible volume in high dimensions.  
d) The distribution spreads uniformly over all radii  
... Incorrect. The mass concentrates sharply around a specific radius.


Title: medium – analyze – non-edge – Behavior of nearest neighbor distances  
Points: 1  
1. Why do distance-based methods like k-nearest neighbors degrade in high-dimensional spaces?  
a) Because distances become infinite as dimension increases  
... Incorrect. Distances do grow in magnitude, but their relative values are what matter.  
*b) Because the difference between the nearest and farthest neighbors becomes small  
... Correct. In high dimensions, distances concentrate — making "nearest" points no longer meaningfully closer than others.  
c) Because the number of neighbors becomes too large to compute  
... Incorrect. The number of neighbors is fixed by $k$, not by the dimensionality.  
d) Because the Gaussian density drops to zero in high dimensions  
... Incorrect. Falling density doesn't explain the collapse of distance contrast between points.


Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – Axis length needed to retain cube volume  
Points: 1  
1. In a uniform distribution over the $[0,1]^D$ cube, how much of each axis must be retained to keep 95% of the total volume as $D$ increases?  
a) A fixed central subregion like $[0.25, 0.75]^D$  
... Incorrect. This subregion’s volume shrinks exponentially with dimension.  
*b) Nearly the full length of each axis  
... Correct. To preserve 95% of the volume, each axis must span nearly $[0,1]$ as $D \to \infty$.  
c) Exactly half of each axis  
... Incorrect. That only retains $(0.5)^D$ of the volume.  
d) Any range of fixed width, as long as it’s centered  
... Incorrect. Fixed-width ranges shrink to negligible volume in high dimensions.

Title: medium – understand – edge – Misinterpretation of the Gaussian shell  
Points: 1  
1. What is the most accurate interpretation of the “Gaussian shell” phenomenon in high dimensions?  
a) Most points lie exactly on a spherical surface at radius $\sqrt{D}$  
... Incorrect. There is no literal surface; points cluster in a narrow range of radii.  
*b) Most points lie within a thin range of distances from the origin centered around $\sqrt{D}$  
... Correct. This reflects the concentration of norm values due to high dimension.  
c) Most points lie near the origin due to high density there  
... Incorrect. While the origin has high density, its volume is negligible.  
d) Most points are spread evenly across all distances  
... Incorrect. The distribution concentrates strongly near a characteristic radius.
