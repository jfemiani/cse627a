Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – What is pattern recognition  
Points: 1  
1. According to PRML, what defines pattern recognition?  
*a) Automatic identification of patterns in data  
... Correct. Pattern recognition refers to learning structure from data.  
b) Guaranteed correct classification  
... Incorrect. Pattern recognition is typically probabilistic.  
c) Requires human-labeled data  
... Incorrect. Not all approaches are supervised.  
d) None of the above  
... Incorrect. Option A is accurate.

Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – Supervised vs. unsupervised learning  
Points: 1  
1. Which best differentiates supervised from unsupervised learning?  
*a) Supervised uses labeled data; unsupervised does not  
... Correct. This is the fundamental difference.  
b) Supervised memorizes; unsupervised generalizes  
... Incorrect. Both can generalize or overfit.  
c) Supervised uses unlabeled data  
... Incorrect. That’s reversed.  
d) Supervised needs known outcomes; unsupervised does not  
... Incorrect. Partially true, but too vague.

Title: concept-check – understand – non-edge – Goal of ML algorithms  
Points: 1  
1. What is the main goal of machine learning algorithms?  
a) Predict with 100% accuracy  
... Incorrect. Perfection is not feasible; generalization is key.  
*b) Learn from data to make predictions or decisions  
... Correct. This is the fundamental objective of ML.  
c) Analyze data for scientific discovery  
... Incorrect. This is an application, not the goal itself.  
d) Generate new theories  
... Incorrect. Theory generation may result from ML, but it’s not the primary goal.

Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – Example of supervised learning  
Points: 1  
1. Which of the following is a supervised learning task?  
a) Predicting stock prices without historical labels  
... Incorrect. No labels implies it's not supervised.  
b) Document clustering  
... Incorrect. Unsupervised grouping of text.  
c) Recommending movies without explicit feedback  
... Incorrect. Often uses implicit data, not labels.  
*d) Classifying handwritten digits  
... Correct. This is a classic supervised task with labeled data.

Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – Example of unsupervised learning  
Points: 1  
1. Which of the following is an example of unsupervised learning?  
a) Image classification  
... Incorrect. This requires labels.  
b) Object detection  
... Incorrect. Requires bounding box labels.  
*c) Clustering  
... Correct. Clustering groups data without needing labels.  
d) Feature selection with labels  
... Incorrect. That’s a supervised preprocessing step.

Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – Generative vs. discriminative  
Points: 1  
1. What is the key difference between generative and discriminative models?  
*a) Generative models learn $p(x, y)$; discriminative learn $p(y|x)$  
... Correct. This is the textbook distinction.  
b) Generative models are more flexible  
... Incorrect. Flexibility depends on model class, not this distinction.  
c) Discriminative models assume fewer priors  
... Incorrect. This is vague and not generally true.  
d) None of the above  
... Incorrect. Option A is accurate.

Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – Example of a generative model  
Points: 1  
1. Which of the following is a generative model?  
a) K-nearest neighbors  
... Incorrect. This is a non-parametric classifier.  
b) Decision tree  
... Incorrect. It models decision boundaries, not joint distributions.  
*c) Gaussian mixture model  
... Correct. GMMs model the joint distribution $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$.  
d) Support vector machine  
... Incorrect. SVMs are discriminative margin-based classifiers.

Title: concept-check – remember – non-edge – Example of non-parametric model  
Points: 1  
1. Which of the following is an example of a non-parametric model?  
a) Linear regression  
... Incorrect. Assumes a fixed parameter form.  
b) Logistic regression  
... Incorrect. Also has a fixed parameterization.  
*c) Decision tree  
... Correct. Tree complexity grows with data, not fixed parameters.  
d) Naive Bayes  
... Incorrect. Typically treated as a parametric model.


Title: medium – apply – non-edge – Scenario: supervised vs. unsupervised  
Points: 1  
1. A dataset of user behavior logs is analyzed to discover usage patterns without any labeled outcomes. What type of learning is this?  
a) Supervised learning  
... Incorrect. There are no labels provided.  
*b) Unsupervised learning  
... Correct. Discovering structure without labels is unsupervised.  
c) Reinforcement learning  
... Incorrect. No actions or rewards are involved.  
d) Discriminative modeling  
... Incorrect. This term applies to modeling strategy, not learning paradigm.

Title: medium – understand – non-edge – Generative vs. discriminative: modeling trade-offs  
Points: 1  
1. Why might discriminative models like logistic regression outperform generative models like Naive Bayes in classification tasks?  
a) Discriminative models require more parameters and are more expressive  
... Incorrect. Generative models typically require more parameters, as they model $p(x, y)$ rather than just $p(y|x)$.  
*b) Discriminative models avoid modeling unnecessary aspects of the data distribution  
... Correct. They directly optimize for predictive performance by focusing only on $p(y|x)$.  
c) Generative models assume linear decision boundaries  
... Incorrect. Many generative models allow for nonlinear decision surfaces.  
d) Discriminative models use prior knowledge about the input distribution  
... Incorrect. That is typically a characteristic of generative models, not discriminative ones.
