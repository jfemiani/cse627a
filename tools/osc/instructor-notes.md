# Instructor Notes

1.  You must create a new project and request a course budget. Allow several days for them to process. The will give you a project ID (e.g. PMUI0206) and a budget (e.g. $500.00) in osc credits. 

     - Make a note of the project ID. This will be needed to start the interactive session etc. 
     
2. Use https://my.osc.edy to login to the system and manage the project.

3.  Add yourself to the project (seems redundant but you seem to need to add yourself)
    - Wait 20 minutes after adding yourself before you test that you have access/ 
  
4. Log onto https://ondemand.osc.edu to access the interactive apps
   
5. Enroll the students and share the student instructions in this folder...
